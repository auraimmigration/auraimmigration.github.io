This includes templates for quotes, invoices, emails. Templates allows you to portray information in a sleek and presentable manner so that it is easy for you as well as your clients to understand.
Extending it to further, we have created a brand new template called the Standard – Indian Style template specifically for the Indian consumers. This template include organization name, client name, addresses of both organization and customer, item details, subtotals etc. Currently this template has been added under invoices, in future it will be implemented for estimates.
