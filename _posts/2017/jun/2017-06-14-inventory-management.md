## Value Adjustment
You make a value adjustment to your stock in your inventory, when the value of the stock increases or decreases due to any reason.
**For example: **If the value of the stock of microwave you have, decreases due to aging, you need to make a value adjustment on the Current Value, by typing the new value against Change Value. The Adjusted Value field will automatically get populated with the appropriate value.
