# What are your options for Canadian Immigration?


### The right Canadian immigration program for you will depend on your qualities, your goals, and your particular situation


The Canadian federal and provincial governments are constantly updating their programs to ensure that Canadian immigration is successful, both for newcomers and for Canada. There are currently more than 60 programs available for immigration to Canada. For that reason, everyone's path to Canadian immigration will be unique.

For example, there are many different categories for professionals and workers under which you might qualify for your Canada Immigration permanent resident visa, including the Federal and Quebec Skilled Worker programs, the Provincial Nominee Programs, the Canadian Experience Class, the Quebec Experience Class, and the Federal Self-Employed program. Canada also offers a number of Family Class Sponsorship programs, whereby Canadian citizens and permanent residents may sponsor family members and loved ones for Canadian immigration.
