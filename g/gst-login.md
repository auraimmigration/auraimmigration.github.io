## GST Login – Your First Step toward Filing GST Return
{: .title-canvas #gst-login} 
GST has been a revolution in the tax system in India as it subsumes all the indirect taxes to leave the taxpayers with only a single indirect tax. Depending on the type of goods and services, this indirect tax has been further categorized into 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% tax slab, respectively. However, prior to paying taxes under GST, you need to register with the GST portal of the Government of India. Once you create an account with the GST site, you can login with your credentials and proceed with your GST tax paying regime thereafter.
