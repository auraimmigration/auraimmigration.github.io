This latest indirect GST tax has subsumed all the other existing indirect taxes, thereby reducing the cascading effects of tax duties that were responsible for market inflation. Pitched as ‘One nation, one tax’,GST intends at benefiting everybody in the country and affective none adversely. However, it will take some time before anything could be said about the implementation of this tax; whether GST is a miracle or a mirage. Here is more on this most sought after regime.<h2 class="title-canvas" id="need">The need for GST bill.</h2><p>Prior to the implementation of Goods and Services Tax or GST Bill in India, taxpayers had to pay multiple taxes on goods and services. The complex and confusing tax system used to give way to corruption, hence leading to problems for the government.Among the several included taxes that the traders, manufacturers, and at times commoners, etc. were bound to pay before GST included: <ol> <li><strong>Sales Tax:</strong> Levied on the sales of goods and was divided into Inter-State Sale, Sale during import/export and Intra-State sale. <li><strong>Service Tax:</strong> This included tax on paid services like telephone, advertising, financial assistance, consultancy, health, etc. <li><strong>Value Added Tax:</strong> It was the additional tax paid to the state government. Its rate was decided depending on the state and the type of item. <li><strong>Custom Duty and Octroi Tax:</strong> Levied on imported goods and the tax was paid at country’s port of entry. The tax rate differed as per the nature of goods. <li><strong>Excise Duty:</strong> Also termed as Central Value Added Tax, this indirect tax was levied on goods produced in the country. <li><strong>Anti-Dumping Duty:</strong> This tax was levied by the Central Government on the goods that were exported to other nations at a price comparably lower than the original cost. </ol><h2 class="title-canvas" id="gst-bill">What is GST Bill?</h2><p>As you already know, a bill is a draft of proposed law that is escalated to the Parliament for healthy discussion followed by its approval. Once passed, the bill becomes an act and is implemented throughout the country and the same holds for GST Bill in India as well. After years of speculations and marathon discussions, both the houses of the parliament finally passed four legislations on 6th April 2017 – The Central GST Bill, 2017; The Integrated GST Bill, 2017; The GST (Compensation to States) Bill, 2017; and The Union Territory GST Bill, 2017. This led to the implementation of the much talked about Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1, 2017. The GST bill is hence now transformed to the GST ACT and is being followed under full constitutional rights all over the country.<p>Just to enhance your knowledge, GST is the One Hundred and Twenty Second (122nd) Amendment Bill of the Constitution of India. It is a comprehensive indirect tax that subsumes all the indirect taxes levied on manufacturing, sales, as well as consumption of goods and services all across the nation.It has now replaced all the indirect taxes levied by the Central and State government, respectively, on goods and services.<h2 class="title-canvas" id="components">Components of GST</h2><p><img src="/images/components.png" alt="components of GST" /><p>Various forms of GST have been introduced under the latest GST act. These include: <ol> <li><strong>State GST or SGST:</strong> Handled by the state government, this subsumes all the taxes collected under the state provision. <li><strong>Central GST or CGST:</strong> Handled by the central government, this tax is imposed on Intra State supplies of goods and services by the central government. <li><strong>Integrated GST or IGST:</strong> This tax bill is levied on the all the Inter-state supplies of goods and/or services. It is applicable in cases of import and export of goods and/or services into and from India. The tax thus collected under IGST is shared between state and central government. <li><strong>Union Territory GST or UGST:</strong> This particular GST bill intends to collect tax on every goods and services supply in the union territories.It makes up for the absence of legislature and has properties similar to that of SGST. The UGST is applied to Chandigarh, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Andaman and Nicobar Islands; all being the union territories of India </ol><p>To understand all these GST taxes, namely, CGST, SGST and IGST and identify the conditions that make them applicable, it is important to know whether the transaction is an intra-state or inter-state supply.<h2 class="title-canvas" id="Intra-State">Intra-State Goods or Services supply</h2><p>This occurs when the location of the supplier and the buyer is in the same state. In this type of transaction, the seller is required to collect from the buyer, both Central GST and State GST. As is obvious, while CGST gets collected with Central Government, the State Government acquires the SGST. <img src="/images/intra-state.png" alt="Intra state goods or service supply" /><h2 class="title-canvas" id="inter-state">Inter-State Goods or services supply</h2><p>When the location of the supplier and the place of supply (or buyer) are both in different states, an inter-state supply of goods and/or services takes place. IGST is also levied in the instances of import or export of goods or services or when goods or services are supplied to or by a SEZ unit.In all such types ofGST transactions, the seller collects IGST from the buyer.<h2 class="title-canvas" id="examples">Examples</h2><p>The image below gives a pictorial representation of the working of Dual GST Model within a state. Note how State GST and Central GST are being applied. <img src="/images/dual-gst.png" alt="dual GST within state" /><p>The image below depicts a pictorial representation of the IGST model for transactions between states. Observe the role of the three GST taxes -IGST, SGST and CGST. <img src="/images/igst.png" alt="IGST model" /><h2 class="title-canvas" id="tax-slab">GST Tax Slabs and the contained items</h2><p>Since long, the speculations were ripe about the tax slabs to be introduced under GST. There were uncertainties regarding the number of taxes levied, whether it will be a single one or multiple, depending on the goods and services offered. With the implementation of the GST Bill, all such confusions have now been answered. To be precise, the government of India has kept 1211 items under different tax slabs depending on their respective categories. Here is a brief description of which item/service, etc. goes to which slab under GST.<h2 class="title-canvas" id="5-gst">5% GST</h2><p><img src="/images/5.png" alt="5%" /><p>Besides, other items that have been accommodated under 5% GST tax slab include packaged food items, frozen vegetables, medicines, apparel below Rs 1000, footwear below Rs 500, Postage or revenue stamps, Branded food, fibre products like mats, pouches, wallets, skimmed milk powder, dried tamarind, walnuts, cashew nuts, Rosaries and prayer beads, Cotton quilts under Rs 1000 per piece, corals, and so on.
