After going through various phases under successive governments, the GST Bill was finally approved in the parliament on 29th March 2017, followed by its implementation on 1st July 2017. Also termed as the ‘one nation, one tax’ system, GST brought the nation of 1.3 billion,one step closer toward integrating the $2-trilllion economy into a unified market. However, to make GST a real success on the ground, it requires honest participation from all the citizens of India. It makes time, but altogether, GST is all poised to change the economic status of the nation forever.<p>To be precise, for businesses whose turnover exceeds 20 lakhs in a year, GST registration has been made mandatory. The threshold limit to apply for GST for North Eastern and Hill States has been set as Rs 10 lakhs. If you also fall under this GST category,you would require doing GST registration online before the deadline ends. But isn’t it good to know the need for GST before we proceed for GST registration for an existing or new business.<h2 class="title-canvas" id="why_gst">WHY GST?</h2><p>The rolling out of GST has been a watershed moment for India. Prior to the introduction of GST, the indirect tax regime in India was quite complex where the tax payers had to comply with large number of taxes levied by both the central as well as state governments. These pre GST taxes included Central Excise duty, Value Added Tax (VAT), Entry Tax, Purchase Tax, Service Tax, Central Sales Tax, Octroi, Local Body Taxes, Luxury Tax and so on. All these tax forms were not even interconnected, hence leaving ample scope for tax evasion. Thankfully, GST answers all such flaws.<p>Goods and Services Tax or GST hence simplified the pre-existing tax regime. It levies uniform tax rates across states for all types of inter-state and intra-state transactions, which will in turn endorse compliance and ease of doing business. GST will also reduce the scope for corruption and tax evasion due to following reasons: <ol> <li>GST, or the ‘one indirect tax for the whole nation’ will reduce net tax liability of the taxpayers and makes them eligible to take tax credit on the inputs throughout India. In fact, GST has already increased the number of tax payers in India appreciably since the news of GST implementation broke out. <li>From GST registration to filling GST returns, to getting all the orders, refunds, etc, everything shall be done online, which will further minimize the interface between the officers and the taxpayers. <li>The GST promotes a dual monitoring structure which involves Center and the State government, which is yet another step towards the prevention of corruption and evasions. <li>Other important factors related to GST, like electronic cross matching of transactions, invoice-wise declaration of sales and purchases, easy tax compliance, Dual control, comprehensive IT structure by GST Identification Number (GSTIN), and more will also contribute toward shutting the door for generating black money. </ol><h2 class="title-canvas" id="registration_tag">Online GST Registration</h2><p>Now let’s know in detail about the process to register for GST, which is quite simple.
